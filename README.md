Hello there <!-- General Kenobi! --> ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antonio RomÃ¡n, I am from MÃ¡laga (Spain), and I am an enthusiast
videogame development student focused in programming and level design at
Complutense University of Madrid.

You may know me in real life, but you also may know me for projects such as the
[Discord] bot [Skyra] which I have been working on since November 2016,
as well as for my work at the [Dirigeants] and [Skyra Project] organizations
as a core developer. Maybe you have heard of me from [Veza], an IPC/TCP
communication system protocol I made to make cross-process messaging easier.

I'm mostly active on [Discord] and [Twitter], so if you ever want to get in
contact with me then you can best do so by joining [my Discord server] or
[tweeting at me].
